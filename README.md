# Instruction to run the app.

- You have to specify the environment variables (see .env-example).
- There are some details to consider when specifying those variables:
    - The environment variable "DEBUG_STATE" (True / False) defines if the
      Django app runs in debugger mode or not. 
    - The environment variable "DATABASE_STATE" (Local / Deploy) define if the
        Django app uses the local database or specified URL database. 
      - If DATABASE_STATE=Local you have to specify DATABASE_STATE,
        DATABASE_NAME, DATABASE_USER, DATABASE_PASS, DATABASE_HOST and 
        DATABASE_PORT. (these are already defined for local docker-compose app).
      - If DATABASE_STATE=Deploy you only have to define DATABASE_URL.
